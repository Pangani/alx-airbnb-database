### Sample Data for the AirBnB Database 
 
This data includes:  
- **Users** – 4 users with roles (guest, host, admin).  
- **Properties** – 2 listings created by a host.  
- **Bookings** – reservations made by guests for the properties.  
- **Payment Methods** – lookup values (credit card, PayPal, Stripe).  (Optional: PayChangu)
- **Payments** – example transaction linked to a booking.  
- **Reviews** – guest ratings and comments on properties.  
- **Messages** – sample communication between users (guest ↔ host).  

The dataset is small but still demonstrates real-world usage of the platform and can be used for:  
- Testing queries  
- Validating schema relationships  
- Seeding a development or demo database
